# Arduino101

This repository contains a collection of beginner-itermediate level Arduino projects that I completed as part of an Arduino course. These projects are designed to help beginners get familiar with the Arduino platform and its capabilities.

## Projects

The projects included in this repository are:

- **Binary LED Counter:** A program that counts in binary on five LEDs.

- **Multi-LED Blink:** A program that blinks multiple LEDs at the same time.

- **Multi-LED Timed Blink:** A program that blinks multiple LEDs at different intervals.

- **LED Brightness Impulse Changer:** A program that changes the brightness of an LED in three different levels of intensity.

- **Potentiometer Voltage Reader:** A program that reads the voltage of a potentiometer and displays it in the serial monitor.

- **Photoresistor Illumination Detector:** A program that detects the level of illumination in a room using a photoresistor.

- **Photoresistor Servo Controller:** A program that uses the input of a photoresistor to control a servo motor.

- **Subject to more additions:** I'm constantly working on many projects and commonly add them to this repository

## Getting Started

To run these projects on your Arduino board, you will need to have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the Arduino IDE from the official website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Once you have installed the Arduino IDE, you can open the project's sketch file (.ino) and upload it to your Arduino board. You may need to install any required libraries that the project uses.
